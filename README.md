Some solutions to ADVH Computing Science tasks

Rules, outlines and assumptions for each of the tasks



## Denary conversion

### Task Outline

Create a program that can convert binary into denary.

### Rules

You may use predefined functions, but you must not use functions that perform the conversion itself.

### Assumptions

There are no spaces in the string.



## Binary conversion

### Task Outline

Create a program that can convert denary into binary.

### Rules

You may use predefined functions, but you must not use functions that perform the conversion itself.

### Assumptions

8 bit binary.

## Triangle of circles

### Task Outline

Create a very simplistic graphic application to draw a triangle of circles. Think of a snooker table or the triangle problem from maths.

### Rules

Do not sit and code each row - you want it to be scalable.

### Assumptions

None.

## Calendar

### Task Outline

Create an app that shows the date (d/m/y format), day of the year (numerical), and day of the week (text)Â for the whole of 2020. You should create the algorithm to do this.

### Rules

You must not use any built-in date functions. You have to calculate everything yourself programmatically.

### Assumptions

25 lines in total done neatly - it would be easy to get that under 20. If you are going much beyond these sorts of line numbers then you may be going astray.
